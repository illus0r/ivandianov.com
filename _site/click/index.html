<h1>Click</h1>
<p>The project focuses on how easily one assigns meaning to seemingly random combinations of blocks, giving them a personality and creating emotional connections.</p>
<p>I was inspired by Ringers in which people see animals and other characters. I wanted to amplify that quality, and the idea of constructing sculptures from blocks came to me when I was away from the computer, camping on the bank of a small river. It clicked! Endless combinations, fun characters, and me with a passion for cubes, voxels, and modular systems!</p>
<p>The sculptures are computed on both CPU and GPU: the positions, sizes and colors of blocks are calculated on CPU and then passed to GPU as a texture. I use technique of hybrid voxel raymarching so we can say the sculptures are made of colored void in a reflected space.</p>
<p>It is possible to fabricate all of the objects in real life, for example, with a 3D printer. Combinations may seem impossible, due to the lack of perspective, but sooner or later it all clicks! It helps to keep in mind that all shapes are symmetrical.</p>
<p>The script uses modern features of GPU so it's supposed to work only on desktop: Chrome, Firefox or Safari</p>
