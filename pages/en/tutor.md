# Generative art and GLSL tutor

I want share my passion with more people so I've started consulting. Particularly I'm interested in raymarching, fractals, voxels, cellular automata, webgl, global illumination, live-coding and the like.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have a specific question or just want to learn more about shaders.

> I've greatly benefited from taking GLSL/shader classes with Ivan. Although many resources are available online for beginner learners, the more advanced topics are not as easily accessible. Together we set up a personalized program for the classes, fitting my prior knowledge and learning goals. Ivan is an engaging teacher, often visualizing more complex topics or breaking things down into clear steps.
