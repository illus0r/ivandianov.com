# Generative art and GLSL tutor

I want share my passion with more people so I've started consulting. Particularly I'm interested in raymarching, fractals, voxels, cellular automata, webgl, global illumination, live-coding and the like.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have a specific question or just want to learn more about shaders.
