Hi! I'm Ivan Dianov (pronounced [eye-van dee-ah-nov]), a generative artist and educator. I teach data art at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/) and am a co-founder of the educational platform [Setka](https://setka.design). I organize shader-based generative live-coding performances where I write code on stage that creates visuals synchronized with music.

A few years ago I founded a community [Genclub](https://genclub.club), which has grown into an amazing community full of talented people generating incredible art and having fun.

Invite me to participate in your projects! Message me on [Telegram](https://t.me/ivan_dianov) or [send me an email](mailto:zor667@gmail.com)

### Artist Statement
Ivan Dianov is a generative artist who uses code to explore processes in complex systems: evolution, organism development, and all phenomena where simple interactions between multiple components lead to complex and unpredictable behavior of the system as a whole.

I develop interactive web applications that allow users to control complex systems, modify their parameters, and observe emerging patterns. My artistic practice involves experimentation with multi-agent systems, cellular automata, and generative grammars.

I intentionally use bugs in my code to create artistic effects. A bug symbolizes both the complexity of our world and the limitations of human consciousness. The world consists of countless bugs layered upon each other. The artist himself, and all people, are the result of countless DNA replication errors. The world is complex and unpredictable, full of mistakes. We can resist this, but it's more pleasant to relax and love the world as it is.

>
> — Sergey Derevyanka, Designer at [ONY Studio](https://ony.ru)

### About Teaching
> "I've greatly benefited from taking GLSL/shader classes with Ivan. Although many resources are available online for beginner learners, the more advanced topics are not as easily accessible. Together we set up a personalized program for the classes, fitting my prior knowledge and learning goals. Ivan is an engaging teacher, often visualizing more complex topics or breaking things down into clear steps."
>
> — [Anna Lucia](https://www.instagram.com/anna.lucia.codes/), generative artist

> "Ivan is amazingly easy to communicate with and open to various experiments as a teacher. In his work with students, he follows an individual approach, explaining complex material with humor and thoroughness using his own code.
>
> As an organizer of the educational process, I was very sorry that I didn't have time to join the participants in the learning. Because the result of the three-day intensive amazes with its brightness and diversity."
> 
> — Varvara Fufaeva, co-director of [Science Art workshop at Summer School](https://www.letnyayashkola.org/science-art/)

> "Lots of feedback about how people liked the workshop. Also many suggestions to extend it to 3 hours and give more time for independent coding.
> Workshop rating 8.9 out of 10. We consider ratings from 8.5 successful, so everything is great here.
> Thank you again for your time!"
> 
> — Inna Savchuk, DevRel at Yandex
