One continuous line crawling out of the printer. Put in disproportionate effort to make this instant noodle mess.

First ported yesterday's snake to G-code, then spent ages begging the printer to extrude at least a bit of plastic. Eventually it worked, still no idea why. Some non-obvious G-code magic. Or maybe I just haven't learned the ropes yet and the magic is all obvious.
