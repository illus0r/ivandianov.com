Low-level 3D printer control via G-code. It's the language computers use to tell printers what to print — a long list of commands for where to move and how much plastic to extrude.

Usually G-code is generated by slicers: they take a 3D model, slice it into layers, and create commands. But you can write G-code by hand! Then you can print not layer-by-layer, but moving up and down — creating intricate structures that slicers can't handle.

Though if you mess up a number, the printer will slam into the part at full speed and wreck everything with horrible sounds. Don't ask how I know this.

Spent two days figuring it out, finally got something interesting. This is a one-dimensional cellular automaton — different steps visible along the cylinder's axis. Love the texture, looks knitted.
