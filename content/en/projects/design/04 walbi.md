# Dynamic Identity for Walbi

Together with designer and art director Dmitry Kostyuchenko, we developed the visual identity for Walbi â€” a crypto-fintech company creating tools for decision-making in the market.

The identity is based on the idea of decentralization and collective behavior. We created a system of autonomous agents that interact with each other based on simple rules, forming living patterns or pixel art.

We used the letter "I" from the logo as the agent.

We created an online editor with several visual styles. Here is the black-and-white version that reacts to mouse movement:

The pearlescent version continuously changes its shape:

Any image can be "decentralized" using our tool:

Agents can become symbols and encrypt any messages:

Agents can also form graphs, pixel images, and even visualize market sentiment. We suggested using the identity this way on the website. See how the rectangles rush to take their places in pixel pictures!

Large pixel graphics are easy to read, even when reduced to the size of a Telegram icon. Of course, we also created an icon set and a sticker pack. Here is the [demo channel where we showcase them.](https://t.me/+NvQVFGTOnjcxZWY6)
