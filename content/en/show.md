# Live Coding

Sometimes I perform live coding — writing code on stage that generates rhythmic visuals in sync with music. It’s a geeky thing: I get invited to tech meetups and conferences. More about live coding

For a performance, I’ll need:
- a projector or a large screen,  
- an HDMI cable to plug into my laptop,  
- a chair and table near the screen,  

I usually perform with a musician or a techno DJ. In this case, we’ll get in touch beforehand and pick the music. I can also find a musician in your city or bring one with modular synths — this will lean more toward art than a party vibe.

I’ve already performed in Moscow, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Tbilisi, and Volgograd, and I’d love to add more cities to the list!
