# Teaching

I teach data art at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru) and generative design at [Setka](https://setka.design).

Sometimes Iâ€™m invited to fly somewhere to give a workshop, lecture, or even a multi-day course. I genuinely enjoy explaining things, and students usually like that.

I also occasionally offer one-on-one training and consultations.

To book a consultation or invite me for a lecture or workshop, message me on [Telegram](https://t.me/ivan_dianov) or [email me](mailto:zor667@gmail.com)
