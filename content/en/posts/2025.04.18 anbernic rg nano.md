I like Pico-8 and have long wanted to get a physical device to play these tiny games, and maybe someday make my own. Sure, you can play on your phone or laptop, but a dedicated device has more vibe!

Recently I learned there's a perfect candidate for this console: a small device with a square screen, aluminum body, and great reviewer feedback. In short, I discovered the Anbernic RG Nano.

Ordered from AliExpress, oddly enough it came via CDEK.

The good news right away — fake08, a pico8 emulator, was included. But there was also a big disappointment: power on/off was unstable. It would turn off from some apps but not others. For example, if you turn off the console while playing pico-8 — it would hang on boot, requiring 15 seconds of holding the power button and then hoping it works this time.

I had the latest official firmware, so decided to try an unofficial one. Installed DrUm78.

Boot became reliable, interface got better, but pico8 didn't work — had to install fake08. This post is a reminder of how I did it, so next time the process is faster.

Followed the instructions, but some obvious things were skipped there.

For example, where to find all those folders you need to find. You need to run the commander, there you can see what to copy where.

I'm actually surprised that such a tiny body has Linux and it boots so fast!
