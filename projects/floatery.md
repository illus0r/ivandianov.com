Floattery takes a name and smack! Creates a float based on it. At last, you can learn more about yourself and your friends.

Don't trust the word, try it yourself:

The floats are combined from the sections we have created. They are not combined at random, but according to the generative grammar rules. They define floats variations: the sections they consist of and the order these sections appear in.

The sequence is random, but this randomness depends on the text field content. The same values will result in the same floats.
